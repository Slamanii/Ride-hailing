# ASAP Ride-hailing Scaffold

This scaffold was generated for you. It includes:
- Anchor Solana program starter (`programs/ride_program`)
- `web/` Next.js + TypeScript starter with Tailwind placeholders
- `mobile/` Expo React Native TypeScript starter with an Account screen
- Monorepo `package.json` using npm workspaces
- Basic TypeScript Anchor test
- WebSocket flow doc and setup script

Defaults used:
- TypeScript across web & mobile
- Expo for React Native
- Anchor (Rust) for Solana program
- npm workspaces

## Quick start (local)
1. Inspect files in this zip.
2. Run `bash scripts/setup.sh` to see suggested commands for environment setup.
3. For Anchor program: install Rust + Solana toolchain (see Anchor docs).
4. For web: run `cd web && npm install && npm run dev` (Next.js dev)
5. For mobile: `cd mobile && npm install && expo start`

This scaffold is minimal and intended as a starting point. Expand components, integrate wallet adapters, and wire up the Anchor program as needed.
